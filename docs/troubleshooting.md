Known Limitations
=================

Although we strive to make Modelur flawless, there are some problems we can not bypass. We are aware of the following limitations, and we will do our best to improve them in future versions of Modelur:

 - Undo/Redo mechanism is not perfect. *Proposed solution:* avoid using Undo/Redo actions on Modelur objects.
 - When using Value Control Box to specify exact distance of pushpull when manually editing the building to add eg. terrace, user can input the exact distance only once. *Proposed solution:* please re-select face and pushpull the face again.
 - Complex/Mixed-use Buildings currently don't take into account terraces and loggias when calculating Gross Floor Area.
